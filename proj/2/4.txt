Uniform	Equal probability       | Dice rolls, random IDs
Normal	Natural variation       | Heights, exam scores
Exponential	Time between events	| Time between customer arrivals
Poisson	Number of events        | Calls per hour at a call center
Binomial Success/failure counts | Defective items in a batch      
------------------------------------------------------------------
Normal distribution example:
Human height
Measurement errors
IQ scores
Exponential distribution:
Waiting time until next customer
Time until system failure
