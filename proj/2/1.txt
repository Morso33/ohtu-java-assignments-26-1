I decided to use an inverse transform method for discrete distributions.

For each of the 1000 samples we draw a uniform random integer x from the range [1, 100]

Then I'll map the results to age value

Next I'll scan the cumulative distribution table from top to bottom, and select the age corresponding to the first row where x ≤ cumulative limit

Next let's record the result.

1. Store the generated age value
2. Increment a counter for that age

Then I'll run the above code in a for loop 1000 times.

Then just count how many times each age was generated (out of 1000)
1. Calculate percentages: (count / 1000) × 100%
2. Compare the generated distribution to the original probability distribution
