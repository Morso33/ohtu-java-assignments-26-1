---Customer-Based Measures---

Updated when events happen to customers.

Arrival count (A) -> updated at arrival.

Response time (Ri) -> computed at departure.

Waiting time sum (W) -> updated when a customer leaves.

Completed count (C) -> updated at service completion.

These are tied to customer lifecycle events.

---Service Point-Based Measures---

Updated based on service point state changes.

Busy time (B) -> updated when service starts and ends.

Utilization (U) -> computed from busy time.

Service time (S) -> derived from B and C.

These are tied to server state changes (idle <-> busy).

---Time-Averaged Measures---

Depend on accumulated time.

N (average number in system) -> based on time integration.

U -> ratio of busy time to total time.

X -> throughput over time.

These require continuous accumulation over simulation time.
