Directly Observable Variables

A (Arrived clients count)
Total number of patients who arrive at the health centre during the simulation time.

C (Completed clients count)
Total number of patients who finish their appointment and leave.

B (Busy time)
Total time the doctor is actively treating patients.

T (Total simulation time)
Total time the health centre is observed (e.g., 8 hours).

Derived Variables

U (Utilization), U = B / T
Fraction of time the doctor is busy.

If U ≈ 1 → doctor is almost always busy (possible overload).

If U is low → doctor is idle frequently.

X (Throughput), X = C / T
Number of patients treated per unit time (e.g., patients/hour).

S (Average service time), S = B / C
Average time a doctor spends treating one patient.

Additional Observable Variables

Ri (Individual response time)
Time from patient arrival to completion of treatment (waiting + service).

W (Cumulative response time)
Sum of all patients’ response times.

Further Derived Quantities

R (Average response time), R = W / C
Average time a patient spends in the system.

N (Average number in system), N = W / T
Average number of patients in the health centre (waiting + in service).

Interpretation in the Health Centre

High U may indicate overworked staff.

High R means long patient waiting times.

High N means congestion.

Balanced X, U, and R indicate efficient operation.
