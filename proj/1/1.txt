A) Supermarket checkout system

B) Traffic at an intersection

C) Hospital emergency department

Why simulation is appropriate?

Real-world experimentation is expensive and disruptive
    You can’t easily shut down a supermarket or hospital to test different staffing levels.
    Changing traffic lights experimentally could cause congestion or accidents.

The system contains randomness
    Arrival times of customers
    Service times vary between individuals
    Traffic flow fluctuates throughout the day

Time savings
    A simulation can model weeks or months in seconds.
    Real-world testing would take too long.

Risk-free experimentation
    Poor decisions in a simulation have no real-world consequences.
    You can safely test worst-case scenarios.

Example:
A supermarket simulation can minimize energy use by optimizing opening hours and staffing while keeping customer wait times acceptable.
